# BLE Sensor Connect
Make your phone connect BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy) cycling sensors, including Heart Rate sensor, cadence &amp; cycling sensor, power sensors. The repository demo includes Android and iOS project.

Tips:
**On Android devices, you need to give the application Location service permission, otherwise can not scan any BLE sensors. It's also weird for me.**
